# Intro to Python (Part 1)

### Workshop Lead

Benjamin Rudski

### Approximate duration

4 hours

### Summary

In this workshop, attendees will be introduced to the basics of programming in Python. Students will journey from the basics of the computer to writing clean, detailed code that can perform simple tasks. By the end of this workshop, attendees will be able to write simple programs in Python, understand existing code and use existing code from published modules and packages.

### Learning Objectives

1. Use variables and collections to represent data in Python code.
2. Use control flow and loops to write powerful code.
3. Use functions from existing packages and modules.
