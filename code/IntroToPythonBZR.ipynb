    "Welcome! In this interactive Jupyter Notebook, I will introduce you to the [Python](https://www.python.org) programming language. In this journey, we'll go from understanding the basics of computers to creating variables, using functions and working with packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is the **student version**, which contains several blanks where I will write code during the workshop and where you can fill out exercises. There is a **solution version** in the [`solutions`](../solutions/) folder. I recommend trying the exercises yourself before looking at the solutions, There is often more than one way to answer a programming question, so you should focus more on understanding the code that you are writing, instead of just copying my answers. You may come up with an answer better than the one I've provided!\n",

    "Welcome! In this first module, we won't be writing any code, but we'll see a bit about what computers are and how we can tell them to perform different tasks. Here's the outline for this module:\n",

    "## Basic Concepts and Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "This section deals with the big questions in life! What's a computer? What are we doing here? How are we doing it? What is the meaning of life??? Ok, maybe not that one... But still, here, we'll see the basic motivation for what we're doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Computer? What is Programming?\n",
    "In this section, we'll briefly see what a computer is and how programming helps us do what we want to do with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the inside of a computer:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Computer inside](../assets/Dell_G5_5000_motherboard.jpg)\n",

    "\n",
    "For our intents and purposes, a computer is a machine that has **two parts**:\n",
    "1. RAM (memory)\n",
    "2. CPU (processor)\n",
    "\n",
    "These parts each do very specific tasks:\n",
    "* The **memory** stores information that we want to process.\n",
    "* The **processor** performs operations on data, using inputs to produce an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, computers are much more complicated that these two parts, but these are the most important for us. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Program?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have this hardware... but what can we do with it? We must provide it with a set of **instructions** to tell the hardware what to do. These instructions are a *program*. The job of *programming* involves writing instructions that tell the computer what *operations* the CPU should perform, and which *data* it should operate on.\n",
    "\n",
    "A program is a **text file**. That's it. Well, actually, not exactly, but that's part of it. We'll discuss more about this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "But... how are these instructions actually written? Introducing...\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Programming Languages?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Programming languages** provide the rules for writing programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Who are programming languages designed to help: you (the programmer) or the computer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's pause to think about it...\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer: **you**\n",
    "\n",
    "A program contains code that **you** write using a programming language. The computer only sees this as text. That's it. There's absolutely nothing special about the file. The computer doesn't run this text file. The computer has to turn this file into something that it can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make a biology analogy. Let's think about DNA, RNA and Proteins. Let's ignore non-coding RNA and ribozymes and let's just focus on the classical paradigm of the central dogma. DNA encodes instructions to build proteins. But, the DNA itself doesn't do the same function as the protein. It only tells the cell how to make the protein. The DNA must be transcribed to RNA and then **translated** using the ribosome to form a functional protein. \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, computers are similar! The program is a text file containing instructions. **You** write code using a programming language, like Python, C++, Java, Kotlin, Swift, etc. All the computer sees is a text file. The computer must process it before it can run it.  The computer then needs to turn these instruction that are *human-readable* into instructions that are *machine-readable*. This is done either using an **interpreter** that runs code line-by-line, for languages like Python, or a **compiler** that process also the code, for languages like C++. "

    "## Welcome to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "And now, for our major focus: Introducing Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Python?\n",
    "For more on the history, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was introduced by Guido Van Rossum in 1991. It has a number of features:\n",
    "* Free and open source\n",
    "* Interpreted language\n",
    "* Object-oriented language\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Free and Open Source\n",
    "Being a free and open source language, anyone can download and use Python, but also more! Anyone can distribute Python and even modify Python, or contribute to its development. Python is developed by the **community** that uses it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpreted\n",
    "Python is an *interpreted* language, **not** a *compiled* language. This means that the entire program file is not translated into machine code before it is run. Instead, only parts of the program are translated when they need to be. This means that when you make a change to one part of a program, you don't need to rebuild your entire project. You often just need to restart your interpreter. This also means that you can open Python in your terminal, type in a single line, and it will work!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Object-Oriented\n",
    "In Python, we use **objects** to represent things. Yeah... I know that doesn't really help. So, objects are a way of representing something, and they group together **data** about that thing (in the form of *attributes*) and **manipulations** that you can do with that thing (in the form of *methods*). Lots of things in Python are represented using these objects from strings of text to lists and you can even make your own (we won't cover that today).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to install Python\n",
    "\n",
    "You've probably done this in the setup for the workshop. There are a number of ways to download Python. If you're on macOS or Linux, lucky you! You might already have Python installed. To see if you do, just open up a terminal window (on macOS, it should be under `Applications > Utilities > Terminal` and on Linux you may be able to just press `Ctrl+Alt+T` to open a terminal window). Once you're there, type `which python`. If you see something that isn't an error message, you already have python. You may also have to try `which python3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if you don't have Python installed, you can install it from Python's website at https://www.python.org or get it from the Windows Store or your local software repository on Linux. But, there's another way that is quite helpful: using a Python distribution such as **Anaconda** or **miniconda**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why use Anaconda? Well, it comes with **many** pre-installed packages which are very helpful in science, such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and more! It's a bit of a big download and the install takes a bit of time, but it is definitely worth it. To get Anaconda, just go to https://www.anaconda.com/ and hit the big green `Download` button. There is a graphical installer for Windows and macOS and a text-based installer for Windows, macOS and Linux. If you don't want to perform a 600 MB download, you can opt for miniconda instead. Go https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html and click on one of the download links. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Anaconda, miniconda doesn't come with the packages pre-installed, but it provides you with the `conda` tool to help you install them. We'll discuss Packages more later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if you don't want to install Python, then good news! If you have a Google Account, then you can use Python on the web. I'll discuss this more very soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools for Programming in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many tools out there for programming in Python:\n",
    "* **Jupyter Notebooks:** Let's start with the tool that we're using now! This tool lets us combine code, explanations and figures. This is really good if you want to share your code with extra details. With a Google Account, you can use Jupyter notebooks remotely via **Google Colab**.\n",
    "* **`python` shell:** This is the most basic way of running a script in the command line or using an interpreter to run one line at a time.\n",
    "* **`ipython` shell:** Similar to the regular Python shell, but with better auto-complete and syntax highlighting.\n",
    "* **Microsoft Visual Studio Code:** code editor that can also be used for debugging and running Jupyter notebooks. Python extension necessary.\n",
    "* **Spyder:** Fully-fledged integrated development environment (IDE). Write and debug code, view figures.\n",
    "* **PyCharm:** Fully-fledged IDE developed by JetBrains. This tool is great for working on larger Python projects. Community edition is open-source.\n",
    "\n",
    "![vscode](../assets/vscode.png)  \n",
    "A familiar Jupyter notebook opened in Microsoft Visual Studio Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "![pycharm](../assets/pycharm.png)  \n",
    "Working with a Python file in PyCharm Community Edition.\n",
    "\n",

    "A sample Spyder window. This may look familiar if you're used to working with MATLAB or RStudio."

We (and the computer) know this because the line starts with the symbol `#`. Python ignores that symbol and everything that comes after it, letting you write notes about what your code is doing. It's very important to put comments in your code, especially if you're going to need to come back to it after a few weeks or if you're going to share it with other people.\n",

While it's not necessary in this Jupyter notebook (which automatically outputs the result of the last line of code), it's very helpful if you're ever writing code in a different program, like *PyCharm* or *Spyder*. We'll discuss functions in more detail later, but the idea is that functions take inputs, known as **arguments**, do operations on them and optionally return some sort of modified result. Here, the `print` function takes in the **string** of text \"Hello, World!\", writes it onto the screen and doesn't return any new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **argument** that we pass to this function is the text **string** `\"Hello, World!\"`. We'll discuss strings in more detail later. The important thing is that a string is a group of characters surrounded by quotation marks (either single quotes `'Hello'` or double quotes `\"Hello\"`).\n",

    "\n",
    "* A **string** represents *text* in Python. We can use **slicing** to access its elements. We can also perform operations, like **concatenation and string formatting**, and use **methods** to get extra info about a string or create modified versions of it.\n",
    "* A **tuple** represents a *small number of objects grouped together*. To access elements, we can either use slicing, or we can **unpack** its contents into the corresponding number of variables. Tuples can't be modified.\n",
    "* A **list** represents a *variable-length collection* of objects. We can add or remove objects from the list using **list methods**, such as `append`, `insert` and `pop`. We can also iterate over all elements of a list using a `for` loop.\n",
    "* A **dictionary** represents *key-value storage*. Instead of having a numeric index, we access **values** using a **key**. We can add or remove elements using keys and we can modify the dictionary using **dictionary methods**, such as `pop` and `update`. We can also use the `keys`, `values` and `items` methods to get different pieces of information.\n",
    "* All of these are **objects**, which means that they store information and have functions, or **methods** associated with them.\n",
    "* We can iterate over all these types of objects to process individual elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about any of these objects, check out the official Python documentation. There's a lot of detail about each type:\n",
    "* Strings: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str\n",
    "* Tuples: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple\n",
    "* Lists: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list\n",
    "* Dictionaries: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict\n",

    "To install a package, first you can search for it on PyPI. For example, if we want to install Open3D, which is a package for working with 3D point clouds and models, we can search on PyPI. When you click on the result, it even gives you the code to be able to install the package!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To install packages using `pip`, again you must open the command line. At the prompt, you write:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    $ pip install package_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When it's done installing, you can use the package!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** `pip` should come with just about any installation of Python. If you didn't install Anaconda, things may get a bit messy. There are two major versions of Python in use: 2.7 and 3.*. On some operating systems, typing in `python` or `pip` on the command line use Python 2, while you must use `python3` or `pip3` to use the more updated and supported version of Python. When you install Anaconda, you no longer need to deal with this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Requirements and Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to how we exported a `conda` environment, we can export a list of package versions with `pip`. The package information is stored in a **requirements** file, commonly called `requirements.txt`. To create this file, at the command line, you use `pip freeze`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    $ pip freeze > requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, on another computer, if you want to install all these packages, you just write:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    $ pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create multiple environments using `pip` and `virtualenv`. If you have both `conda` and `pip` installed, the `conda` [documentation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) recommends trying to install packages with `conda` first. Creating these virtual environments is outside the scope of this workshop, but there's plenty of online documentation that can help."

Use software that is made for coding!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "I mentioned this one earlier. Big projects have big documentation. Take a look at their guides for getting started. For example, [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) has a [10 minutes to pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html) tutorial. Use these resources! If you want to learn how to use a function, **look it up** and read the paragraph about it. It will tell you how to use the arguments, any quirks to expect, and in some cases it will give you references about the papers behind the function. This is especially true in image processing and other fields that rely heavily on algorithms. So, the documentation will tell you not only how to use the code, but also **where it comes from**. And make sure to check out the Official Python docs at https://docs.python.org/3/.\n",

    "Tutorials are also great! And very much abundant! From more formal ones on sites like [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) to less formal ones on [DEV](https://dev.to/), you can get lots of insight from these. There are also lots posted on Medium that you can check out. In addition to text-based tutorials, there are also videos on YouTube. And don't forget the official tutorials in the documentation! Tutorials are a very valuable resource that can help you see how to put pieces of code together in real-world examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stack Overflow (and Pitfalls)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a Python question, chances are that someone, somewhere has asked it on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Stack Overflow is a **great** resource for finding answers to real questions about programming. **But** make sure that you're using it properly. Try the other resources before going to Stack Overflow. The answer may turn out to be on the documentation page for the function you're looking for. If there's a link to the docs in a Stack Overflow answer, **use it**. Check out in more detail. Make sure that you understand the code that you're about to add to your project and don't just copy-paste it. Coding is a thinking game. Make sure that you have thought about all the code that you're putting in and that you understand why it's there. And use your judgement and intuition when borrowing that code. If it looks sketchy, it could very well be sketchy and there may be a better way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ChatGPT (and Pitfalls)\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything I said above about Stack Overflow. And more. Answers on Stack Overflow are written by humans who have written the code, tested it, and run the results. Be careful when using ChatGPT for code (if you're allowed to at all). Make extra sure that it makes sense, and test it. Don't just trust it because AI wrote it for you. You need to make extra sure that it actually makes sense and runs properly, because you don't have that same guarantee that a human has used this exact code in their own experience. Use your coding judgement and intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, ALWAYS remember to **read the documentation**. Often, if you're stuck, the answer is **right there**. If it's not, then it's probably on Stack Overflow. It's often a good idea to check the documentation **first** to see if there's an official explanation or an official example. And don't just copy a Stack Overflow answer or sample code. Think about what the code is doing. Does it make sense? Is there a better way? Try to look line by line to understand what is going on (play around in the IPython interpreter or in a Jupyter notebook!).\n",

    "We've seen how to install and use packages. But, you can also **write your own packages**. There are many great resources online about writing packages. The one that I most recommend is [this free online book](https://py-pkgs.org/): *Python Packages* by Tomas Beuszen and Tiffany Timbers. It's an easy read and helps you learn not only how to organise your code, but how to publish it, too. The authors also walk through how to render your own nice-looking documentation and host that online.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing code with loops and control flow is fun, but it's even better when we can combine everything into functions and classes and work in an **object-oriented** manner. This paradigm helps you organise your code differently, constructing building blocks that can work together to build elaborate programs.\n",

Using PyQt, the process is quite straightforward. Check out [this online tutorial series](https://www.pythonguis.com/) by Martin Fitzpatrick to learn about developing GUIs in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hosting Projects on GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "What fun is a project if other people can't use it? By hosting your project on GitHub, you let others easily contribute to your project and build on it. Learning Git and GitHub are essential! And so are a few other skills along the way, like writing documents in Markdown. MiCM often has Git and GitHub workshops, so check out their workshop schedule!\n",
